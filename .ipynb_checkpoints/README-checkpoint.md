# Car Insurance Claims
**Matthew Malueg**

## Overview

This dataset contains information on numerous customers of a company offering car insurance. Along with demographic information, a simplified claim history is given.

**Stakeholder considerations**: Using this data, try to predict which drivers are likely to file a claim in the future. By finding a way to accurately predict who will make a claim, insurance companies can improve their risk-assessment and management.

The target feature here is 'OUTCOME', detailing whether or not a customer has filed a claim in the past. By using modeling to detect which factors have the largest influence on Outcomes, it would be possible to provide more accurate coverage. The dataset contains ID info that can be dropped during analysis, leaving 17 features to examine.

The remaining data contained here give information on age, race, income, driving experience, year/type of car, and other general demographic info. Although there was no data dictionary available with the data, the feature names are self-explanatory and can be understood easily.
